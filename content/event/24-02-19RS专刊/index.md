abstract: 'Dear Colleagues,

Under the influence of global climate change, rapid urban expansion, and drastic human activities, geological hazards, including landslides, debris flow, and subsidence, occur frequently every year around the world. Numerous geological disasters pose a great threat to human life and property safety, especially in less developed regions. Carrying out the risk study of geological disasters is considered as an effective method to reduce the losses.

Accurate observation of the geohazard phenomena from initiation to failure is the premise for risk analysis and prediction. Traditional ground-based monitoring techniques can directly observe various phenomena of geological hazards, but the high cost and sparse spatial distribution limit their application on the regional scale and in fine evaluations. In recent years, remote sensing methods, such as radar interferometry, UAVs, LiDAR, etc., have been widely used. These advanced approaches make significant contributions to various steps of geological disaster risk prevention, including detection, monitoring, and early warning.

The purpose of this Special Issue is to publish studies covering various applications of remote sensing in risk prevention for geohazards. We invite authors to submit research papers and technical notes on topics including but not limited to the following:

-Advanced remote sensing methods for geohazard observation;
-Detection and monitoring of geological hazards;
-Multi-scale risk analysis and mapping.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
