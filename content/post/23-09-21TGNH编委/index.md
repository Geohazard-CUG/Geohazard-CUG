Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk is an open access journal publishing research on geospatial (GIS and GPS) and remote sensing techniques applied to risk management of natural hazards.
The aim of Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk is to address new concepts, approaches and case studies using geospatial and remote sensing techniques to study monitoring, mapping, risk mitigation, risk vulnerability and early warning of natural hazards.<br>
Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk covers the following topics:<br>
1. Remote sensing techniques;<br>
2. Natural hazards associated with land, ocean, atmosphere, land-ocean-atmosphere coupling and climate change;<br>
3. Emerging problems related to multi-hazard risk assessment, multi-vulnerability risk assessment, risk quantification and the economic aspects of hazards;<br>
4. Results of findings on major natural hazards.<br>
